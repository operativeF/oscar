 * The C[onditional] progress bar causes the progress bar window to show only if the task
 * is not half done in two seconds (number of seconds is variable).  The CProgressBar can
 * thus be used in all situations in which a progress bar might be appropriate without
 * determining ahead of time whether the task will take long enough to warrant use of a progress bar.
 *
 * This is especially useful when even though the number of iterations is known, the time required
 * to perform each iteration is not known ahead of time.  For example, reading summary files and
 * discovering that some need to be updated but others do not.
